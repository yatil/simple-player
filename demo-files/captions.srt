00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,209
Hello!

2
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:05,629
In this episode, I’ll explain the structure
to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

3
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:13,940
— WCAG — and how you can start following
their requirements.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,330
My name is Eric Eggert and I work in Web Accessibility
for over 10 years.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,360
You can follow me as @yatil – Y - A - T - I - L – on social media.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,300
Now, what is WCAG?

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,980
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are a set of principles, guidelines and

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,360
success criteria that lead you to accessible web content.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,500
They are a web standard published by W3C,
the World Wide Web Consortium, and with every

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,680
web standard the assumption is that web content
creators adopt it into their practices.

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:56,980
Version 1 was published in 1999, so over 20
years ago, and Version 2 in 2008.

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,580
It was refreshed in 2018 with WCAG 2.1, which is the current version.

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,140
What’s the difference between WCAG versions,
you ask?

14
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,140
Version 2.0 was a complete rewrite with new
principles and a new structure.

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,229
It completely replaced WCAG 1.0 which was
technically not holding up anymore.

16
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,180
WCAG 2.0 is agnostic to technology, which gave

17
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,740
it a longer shelf-life out of the box.

18
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,400
And it is the basis for accessibility today.

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:39,440
2.1 expanded on WCAG 2.0 by adding new criteria
but without removing or changing any of the

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,740
existing 2.0 guidelines.

21
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:47,780
Think of 2.1 as an extension of WCAG 2.0.

22
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,880
WCAG 2.2, which is supposed to be coming out
soon, basically does the same thing with probably

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,740
one exception.

24
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,409
Subscribe to this channel and click the bell
icon to get notified about new videos, including

25
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,520
a WCAG 2.2 introduction once it is ready.

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,600
When I talk about WCAG in the future, you
can always assume WCAG 2 and I will say the

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,520
specific version number when that’s necessary.

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:23,840
That also means that if you conform to WCAG
2.1, you automatically conform to WCAG 2.0.

29
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,129
How neat!

30
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,700
More about conformance in a bit.

31
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,329
Let's talk about the structure of WCAG 2.

32
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:37,880
The main — normative — WCAG document has
three levels of guidance:

33
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,520
The first level is Principles.

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,880
Principles are basic qualities that every website needs to

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,280
have when it comes to accessibility.

36
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,719
2. Guidelines

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,480
Follow the guidelines when planning and designing

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,180
your website and application to make sure
you’re right on track.

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,100
3. Success Criteria

40
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,819
Verify your work by using success criteria

41
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:10,029
to see if you have been successful following
the guidelines and principles.

42
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:15,609
Sidebar: Normative information is information
that is the confirmed standard as published

43
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:22,780
by the W3C and not additional explaining information, which the W3C also publishes.

44
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,140
Let’s take a closer look at the Principles.

45
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,500
On the first level, four high-level principles
are defined, that you have to keep on your mind.

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,120
The first one is “Perceivable”.

47
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:41,520
Information and user interface components
must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,999
This principle makes sure that disabled people
can see the content or have alternatives available

49
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:49,760
in case they need them.

50
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,049
It covers making images perceivable through
alternative text and videos through captions

51
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,900
and audio descriptions.

52
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,239
2.Operable

53
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,159
User interface components and navigation must
be operable.

54
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:12,419
This principle allows users to use their preferred
technology to operate the website or web application,

55
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,939
for example many users can’t use a mouse,
either because they are using a screen reader

56
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,389
or a refreshable braille display to interact
with a website.

57
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:28,590
Others might have repetitive strain injury
(RSI) and just be temporally unable to use

58
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,440
a pointing device.

59
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,540
3. Understandable

60
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,880
Information and the operation of user interface
must be understandable.

61
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:45,020
This principle is a combination of making
sure that the content is easy to understand

62
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,390
and that you can interact with the website
or application in an understandable way.

63
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,840
For example, this principle covers specifying
the language of the page and parts of text

64
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,040
and also assisting users when filling out
forms.

65
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,139
4. Robust

66
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:09,400
Content must be robust enough that it can
be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents,

67
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,219
including assistive technologies.

68
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:15,710
This is probably the most technical principle.

69
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,789
It underlines how important good code is for
accessibility.

70
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:25,990
If your code is buggy or components are used
wrongly, the technology used by users might

71
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,800
not be able to interpret the information the
way you and users want them to.

72
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,000
Let’s take a look at the Guidelines.

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,879
The Guidelines are situated underneath the
principles and give more specific advice for

74
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,060
different situations.

75
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,940
Principle “1. Perceivable” has four guidelines:

76
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:54,349
1.1 Text Alternatives
Provide text alternatives for any non-text

77
00:05:54,349 --> 00:06:02,449
content so that it can be changed into other
forms people need, such as large print, braille,

78
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,580
speech, symbols or simpler language.

79
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,090
Whenever content is on the page that is useful
or essential for the understanding of the

80
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,229
whole page or view, an alternative in text
form must be provided.

81
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:20,289
That alternative can be used in different
contexts.

82
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:23,580
1.2 Time-based Media

83
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,310
Provide alternatives for time-based media.

84
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,400
Time-based media is WCAG language for (mostly)
audios and videos.

85
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,539
Similar to “text alternatives”, this ensures
that people with different disabilities have

86
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,110
access to the media content.

87
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,249
For example, this guideline requires captions,
to enable access for people who cannot hear

88
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:53,420
narration, and audio descriptions, which enable
access for people who are unable to see a video.

89
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,720
1.3 Adaptable

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,580
Generate [!sic] content that can be presented in different
ways (for example simpler layout) without

91
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,460
losing information or structure.

92
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:10,599
This guideline prepares content to be used
out of the context or styled and viewed differently.

93
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,099
Here’s where semantic markup comes into
play.

94
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:19,419
It also means allowing users to use their
devices in any orientation.

95
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:22,939
1.4 Distinguishable

96
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:29,960
Make it easier for users to see and hear content
including separating foreground from background.

97
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,409
Avoid the use of color alone or low contrast
colors for text, information, and UI elements.

98
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:44,320
Allow resizing of text and changing the viewport,
for example by implementing a responsive design.

99
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,860
The second principle, Operable, has 5 guidelines:

100
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,770
2.1 Keyboard Accessible

101
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,909
Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

102
00:07:55,909 --> 00:08:01,650
This is important as many technologies disabled
people use are using keyboard commands to

103
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,909
navigate around, even as the users are using
joysticks or other input methods.

104
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:10,360
2.2 Enough Time

105
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,289
Provide users enough time to read and use
content.

106
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:21,949
Avoid introducing arbitrary time limits and
let users take as much time as they need.

107
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,479
If there’s a requirement to restrict the
time for a certain task — for example for

108
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:33,349
security reasons — the user must be informed
and given a way to extend the timeout.

109
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,909
2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions

110
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:45,110
Do not design content in a way that is known
to cause seizures or physical reactions.

111
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,660
This guideline targets flashing content and
motion animation.

112
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,460
Note that this guideline was extended to cover
physical reactions with WCAG 2.1, you might

113
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:01,760
find the old wording, which only talks about
seizures, occasionally.

114
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,870
2.4 Navigable

115
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,860
Provide ways to help users navigate, find
content, and determine where they are.

116
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,500
Examples of requirements that come from this
guideline are the ability to bypass blocks

117
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:25,520
of content on the page, having proper page titles, and
proper keyboard focus and a visible focus outline.

118
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,980
2.5 Input Modalities

119
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:35,150
Make it easier for users to operate functionality
through various inputs beyond keyboard.

120
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:41,920
New in WCAG 2.1, this guideline expands interaction
with the page or application when the keyboard

121
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,699
is not used.

122
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:49,300
For example, websites and applications must
provide an alternative to pinch and zoom gestures

123
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,440
you would use two fingers or pointers for.

124
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,580
Principle 3, Understandable has 3 guidelines:

125
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,980
The first one: 3.1 Readable

126
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,760
Make text content readable and understandable.

127
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:10,430
This guideline covers languages and language
transitions, the explanation of unknown words

128
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,300
and abbreviations, reading level, and pronunciation.

129
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,490
3.2 Predictable

130
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,300
Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable
ways.

131
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,709
The guidance in this guideline makes sure
that users are not surprised by the things

132
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:35,570
that happen on the website and also that common
elements look the same.

133
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,500
3.3 Input Assistance

134
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,430
Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

135
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:49,470
This guideline advises to label your form
fields in a useful way, identify errors and

136
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:55,460
provide suggestions on how to prevent errors
in the first place.

137
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,260
The last principle, Robust, has only one guideline:

138
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:03,290
4.1 Compatible

139
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:10,560
Maximize compatibility with current and future
user agents, including assistive technologies.

140
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,320
Write conforming HTML code, make sure that
the names, roles, and statuses of UI elements

141
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,580
are clear.

142
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,880
I won’t go into success criteria this time
— subscribe and click the bell to get a

143
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:29,699
notification when I do — but remember that
these build the ruleset to see if you have

144
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:33,320
met the minimum requirements of the guidelines.

145
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,840
You should always aim to exceed these success
criteria.

146
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,020
When you come across WCAG, you will quickly
stumble over techniques and understanding

147
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,339
documents.

148
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:46,110
They are linked right from the specification!

149
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,620
Note that those documents are non-normative
documents, they can help you to understand

150
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,360
WCAG but their guidance does not necessary
mean you meet WCAG.

151
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,529
The techniques are a collection of examples
of how to meet a success criterion, either

152
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:05,620
narrowly — WCAG calls this “sufficient
technique” — or as a best practice.

153
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,790
WCAG calls this an “advisory technique”.

154
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:14,320
Let’s talk about “Conformance” & “Conformance
Levels”

155
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:19,790
These phrases are often used when people talk
about web accessibility, especially in association

156
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,050
with WCAG and lawsuits.

157
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,280
Conformance determines that the website follows
all guidelines in WCAG and all applicable

158
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,360
success criteria are met.

159
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,060
It is usually used in the testing process
to have something “firm” or absolute to

160
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,440
test against.

161
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,500
However, there’s always some room for interpretation.

162
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,560
WCAG success criteria can have one of three
levels — A, Double-A and Triple-A — and to

163
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,280
reach that conformance non of your page can
violate any success criteria at that level.

164
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,820
The lowest level, A, ensures basic accessibility.

165
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:06,019
If you reach this level, you are not actively
excluding most disabled people.

166
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:12,649
The second level, Double-A, ensures accessibility
for most people with disabilities.

167
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:17,319
This is the level most laws and policies demand.

168
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,239
To reach it, you need to confirm to all success
criteria that are level A and Double-A.

169
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,480
The third level, Triple-A, are what I call
“stretch goals”.

170
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,810
These are either niche or otherwise hard to
achieve. But depending on your website it can

171
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,760
make a lot of sense to offer features that
fall into this conformance level.

172
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:45,100
So, that was an overview on the principles
and guidelines of WCAG as well as a look into conformance.

173
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,200

criteria and generally about web accessibility
