00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.209
Hello!

00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:05.629
In this episode, I’ll explain the structure
to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:13.940
— WCAG — and how you can start following
their requirements.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.330
My name is Eric Eggert and I work in Web Accessibility
for over 10 years.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.360
You can follow me as @yatil – Y - A - T - I - L – on social media.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.300
Now, what is WCAG?

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.980
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are a set of principles, guidelines and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.360
success criteria that lead you to accessible web content.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.500
They are a web standard published by W3C,
the World Wide Web Consortium, and with every

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.680
web standard the assumption is that web content
creators adopt it into their practices.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.980
Version 1 was published in 1999, so over 20
years ago, and Version 2 in 2008.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.580
It was refreshed in 2018 with WCAG 2.1, which is the current version.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.140
What’s the difference between WCAG versions,
you ask?

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.140
Version 2.0 was a complete rewrite with new
principles and a new structure.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.229
It completely replaced WCAG 1.0 which was
technically not holding up anymore.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.180
WCAG 2.0 is agnostic to technology, which gave

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.740
it a longer shelf-life out of the box.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.400
And it is the basis for accessibility today.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:39.440
2.1 expanded on WCAG 2.0 by adding new criteria
but without removing or changing any of the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.740
existing 2.0 guidelines.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.780
Think of 2.1 as an extension of WCAG 2.0.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.880
WCAG 2.2, which is supposed to be coming out
soon, basically does the same thing with probably

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.740
one exception.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.409
Subscribe to this channel and click the bell
icon to get notified about new videos, including

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.520
a WCAG 2.2 introduction once it is ready.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.600
When I talk about WCAG in the future, you
can always assume WCAG 2 and I will say the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.520
specific version number when that’s necessary.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.840
That also means that if you conform to WCAG
2.1, you automatically conform to WCAG 2.0.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.129
How neat!

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.700
More about conformance in a bit.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.329
Let's talk about the structure of WCAG 2.

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.880
The main — normative — WCAG document has
three levels of guidance:

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.520
The first level is Principles.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.880
Principles are basic qualities that every website needs to

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.280
have when it comes to accessibility.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.719
2. Guidelines

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.480
Follow the guidelines when planning and designing

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.180
your website and application to make sure
you’re right on track.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.100
3. Success Criteria

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.819
Verify your work by using success criteria

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.029
to see if you have been successful following
the guidelines and principles.

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:15.609
Sidebar: Normative information is information
that is the confirmed standard as published

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:22.780
by the W3C and not additional explaining information, which the W3C also publishes.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.140
Let’s take a closer look at the Principles.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.500
On the first level, four high-level principles
are defined, that you have to keep on your mind.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.120
The first one is “Perceivable”.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.520
Information and user interface components
must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.999
This principle makes sure that disabled people
can see the content or have alternatives available

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:49.760
in case they need them.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.049
It covers making images perceivable through
alternative text and videos through captions

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.900
and audio descriptions.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.239
2.Operable

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.159
User interface components and navigation must
be operable.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:12.419
This principle allows users to use their preferred
technology to operate the website or web application,

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:17.939
for example many users can’t use a mouse,
either because they are using a screen reader

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:22.389
or a refreshable braille display to interact
with a website.

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:28.590
Others might have repetitive strain injury
(RSI) and just be temporally unable to use

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.440
a pointing device.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.540
3. Understandable

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.880
Information and the operation of user interface
must be understandable.

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.020
This principle is a combination of making
sure that the content is easy to understand

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.390
and that you can interact with the website
or application in an understandable way.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.840
For example, this principle covers specifying
the language of the page and parts of text

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.040
and also assisting users when filling out
forms.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.139
4. Robust

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.400
Content must be robust enough that it can
be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.219
including assistive technologies.

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.710
This is probably the most technical principle.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.789
It underlines how important good code is for
accessibility.

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.990
If your code is buggy or components are used
wrongly, the technology used by users might

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.800
not be able to interpret the information the
way you and users want them to.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.000
Let’s take a look at the Guidelines.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.879
The Guidelines are situated underneath the
principles and give more specific advice for

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.060
different situations.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.940
Principle “1. Perceivable” has four guidelines:

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.349
1.1 Text Alternatives
Provide text alternatives for any non-text

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:02.449
content so that it can be changed into other
forms people need, such as large print, braille,

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.580
speech, symbols or simpler language.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.090
Whenever content is on the page that is useful
or essential for the understanding of the

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.229
whole page or view, an alternative in text
form must be provided.

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.289
That alternative can be used in different
contexts.

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.580
1.2 Time-based Media

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.310
Provide alternatives for time-based media.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.400
Time-based media is WCAG language for (mostly)
audios and videos.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.539
Similar to “text alternatives”, this ensures
that people with different disabilities have

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.110
access to the media content.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.249
For example, this guideline requires captions,
to enable access for people who cannot hear

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:53.420
narration, and audio descriptions, which enable
access for people who are unable to see a video.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.720
1.3 Adaptable

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:01.580
Generate [!sic] content that can be presented in different
ways (for example simpler layout) without

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.460
losing information or structure.

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:10.599
This guideline prepares content to be used
out of the context or styled and viewed differently.

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:14.099
Here’s where semantic markup comes into
play.

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:19.419
It also means allowing users to use their
devices in any orientation.

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.939
1.4 Distinguishable

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:29.960
Make it easier for users to see and hear content
including separating foreground from background.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:36.409
Avoid the use of color alone or low contrast
colors for text, information, and UI elements.

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:44.320
Allow resizing of text and changing the viewport,
for example by implementing a responsive design.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.860
The second principle, Operable, has 5 guidelines:

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.770
2.1 Keyboard Accessible

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.909
Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

00:07:55.909 --> 00:08:01.650
This is important as many technologies disabled
people use are using keyboard commands to

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:07.909
navigate around, even as the users are using
joysticks or other input methods.

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:10.360
2.2 Enough Time

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.289
Provide users enough time to read and use
content.

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:21.949
Avoid introducing arbitrary time limits and
let users take as much time as they need.

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:26.479
If there’s a requirement to restrict the
time for a certain task — for example for

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:33.349
security reasons — the user must be informed
and given a way to extend the timeout.

00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:37.909
2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:45.110
Do not design content in a way that is known
to cause seizures or physical reactions.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.660
This guideline targets flashing content and
motion animation.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:54.460
Note that this guideline was extended to cover
physical reactions with WCAG 2.1, you might

00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:01.760
find the old wording, which only talks about
seizures, occasionally.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.870
2.4 Navigable

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:10.860
Provide ways to help users navigate, find
content, and determine where they are.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:16.500
Examples of requirements that come from this
guideline are the ability to bypass blocks

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:25.520
of content on the page, having proper page titles, and
proper keyboard focus and a visible focus outline.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.980
2.5 Input Modalities

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:35.150
Make it easier for users to operate functionality
through various inputs beyond keyboard.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:41.920
New in WCAG 2.1, this guideline expands interaction
with the page or application when the keyboard

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.699
is not used.

00:09:43.699 --> 00:09:49.300
For example, websites and applications must
provide an alternative to pinch and zoom gestures

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.440
you would use two fingers or pointers for.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.580
Principle 3, Understandable has 3 guidelines:

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.980
The first one: 3.1 Readable

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.760
Make text content readable and understandable.

00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:10.430
This guideline covers languages and language
transitions, the explanation of unknown words

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.300
and abbreviations, reading level, and pronunciation.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.490
3.2 Predictable

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:23.300
Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable
ways.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.709
The guidance in this guideline makes sure
that users are not surprised by the things

00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:35.570
that happen on the website and also that common
elements look the same.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.500
3.3 Input Assistance

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.430
Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:49.470
This guideline advises to label your form
fields in a useful way, identify errors and

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:55.460
provide suggestions on how to prevent errors
in the first place.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.260
The last principle, Robust, has only one guideline:

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:03.290
4.1 Compatible

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:10.560
Maximize compatibility with current and future
user agents, including assistive technologies.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.320
Write conforming HTML code, make sure that
the names, roles, and statuses of UI elements

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.580
are clear.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:23.880
I won’t go into success criteria this time
— subscribe and click the bell to get a

00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:29.699
notification when I do — but remember that
these build the ruleset to see if you have

00:11:29.699 --> 00:11:33.320
met the minimum requirements of the guidelines.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.840
You should always aim to exceed these success
criteria.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:42.020
When you come across WCAG, you will quickly
stumble over techniques and understanding

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.339
documents.

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:46.110
They are linked right from the specification!

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:50.620
Note that those documents are non-normative
documents, they can help you to understand

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.360
WCAG but their guidance does not necessary
mean you meet WCAG.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.529
The techniques are a collection of examples
of how to meet a success criterion, either

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:05.620
narrowly — WCAG calls this “sufficient
technique” — or as a best practice.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.790
WCAG calls this an “advisory technique”.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:14.320
Let’s talk about “Conformance” &amp; “Conformance
Levels”

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:19.790
These phrases are often used when people talk
about web accessibility, especially in association

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.050
with WCAG and lawsuits.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.280
Conformance determines that the website follows
all guidelines in WCAG and all applicable

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.360
success criteria are met.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:36.060
It is usually used in the testing process
to have something “firm” or absolute to

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.440
test against.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.500
However, there’s always some room for interpretation.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:48.560
WCAG success criteria can have one of three
levels — A, Double-A and Triple-A — and to

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:55.280
reach that conformance non of your page can
violate any success criteria at that level.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.820
The lowest level, A, ensures basic accessibility.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:06.019
If you reach this level, you are not actively
excluding most disabled people.

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:12.649
The second level, Double-A, ensures accessibility
for most people with disabilities.

00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:17.319
This is the level most laws and policies demand.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:22.239
To reach it, you need to confirm to all success
criteria that are level A and Double-A.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.480
The third level, Triple-A, are what I call
“stretch goals”.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.810
These are either niche or otherwise hard to
achieve. But depending on your website it can

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.760
make a lot of sense to offer features that
fall into this conformance level.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:45.100
So, that was an overview on the principles
and guidelines of WCAG as well as a look into conformance.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.200

criteria and generally about web accessibility
